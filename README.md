# KD and RP Trees  
## Project  
This project provides implementations of KD-Tree and RP-Tree data structures for efficient nearest neighbour searches in high-dimensional spaces.  
## Features  
### Data Management
+ Handles individual data points and datasets.  
+ Supports vector operations (addition, subtraction, dot product, norm, distance).    
+ Reads datasets from files.  
### KD-Tree
+ Builds KD-Tree using recursive median splits.  
+ Performs k-nearest neighbour searches.  
+ Adds and deletes data points.  
### RP-Tree
+ Builds RP-Tree using recursive random splits.  
+ Performs k-nearest neighbour searches.  
+ Adds and deletes data points.  
### Efficient Search
+ Optimised for fast k-nearest neighbour queries.  
## Usage
1. Choose KD-Tree or RP-Tree.  
2. Load a dataset.  
3. Build the tree.  
4. Perform nearest neighbour searches.   
5. Add or delete data points.  
6. Print the tree structure.
